    3. Git (optional, but recommended)
    4. Code Editor: Visual Studio Code or any other editor

## Installation Steps

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository
Start by cloning the **ShopEZ** repository to your local machine using Git:
```bash
git clone "https://github.com/Dnavee18/ShopEZ_E-commerce.git"
```

### 2. Once cloned, navigate into the project directory:
``` bash
cd ShopEZ
```

### 3. Navigate to the server directory (backend folder) and install the required dependencies using npm or yarn:
```bash
cd server
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 4. Move to the client folder and install the required packages:
```bash
cd ../client
npm install
# or

```

### 5. Run the backend and frontend servers:
```bash
cd server
npm start
